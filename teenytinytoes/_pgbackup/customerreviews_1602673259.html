                    <p>&apos;Alex has made me 6 frames, 3 have been my childrens&rsquo; hands and feet and 3 have been dog prints, two of which were presents for family. It is so wonderful to have a memory of how small my childrens&rsquo; hands and feet were. Alex is down to earth, bubbly and nothing is too much trouble. Her work is incredible and good value for money. She had a very gentle touch with both my children and very nervous dog. I have recommended her to family and friends, thank you Alex for my precious work of art.&apos;</p>

                    <p>&lsquo;We discussed what I wanted and Alex was great at helping me through the process. I opted for both hand and foot casts of my son with an added photo and Alex made everything very easy (she even indulged me when I wanted to change the photo I had provided her with). I would absolutely recommend Alex as the quality of work and collaboration of ideas were of a high standard. I love what she created for me!&rsquo;&nbsp;</p>

                    <p>&lsquo;So far I&rsquo;ve used Alex for handprints and footprints for my two babies and a paw print of my dog. I&rsquo;m so glad that I found her to do these for me. They look lovely, they&rsquo;re done to a high standard and are a great memory to have on my wall. I have even purchased a gift voucher as a baby shower gift, the mum-to-be loved it and I think it is something different and a gift she will keep forever. I will definitely use Alex again for any new additions to our family in the future.&rsquo;</p>

Something that I will treasure forever. Thank you Alex.&rsquo;</p>
